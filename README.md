# CFlow
This is a simple cash flow app for android built using android studio. It allows users to input expenses or income with a description and keeps a running total. Users can edit previously inputted entries and have the option to wipe all data.

It was a great project to help me learn the basics of android development and use of databases in android with Room.

## Areas for future work
- Include timestamps on entries and display entries by time
- Include graphs and other more powerful metrics other than a cumulative sum
- Introduce categories for expenses and sources of income
- Introduce filtering by time period and category
